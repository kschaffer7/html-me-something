        <h1>Kirsti & Cars!</h1>
        <p>
        I grew up in a family that absolutley loves cars.<br>
        Just like Marisa Tomei's character in the movie "My Cousin Vinny", my father was a mechanic, his father was a mechanic, my brother is a mechanic, all my friends are mechanics...<br>
        So, naturally I enjoy cars and making mechanical and subtle appearance changes to them.<br>

        <h2>My First Car - 1993 Honda Civic Hatchback</h2>
        <p>
        My first car was the 1993 Honda Civic Hatchback.<br>
        These cars became extremely popular throughout the 2000's thanks to the movie "The Fast and The Furious".<br>
        These cars were very cheap to own and maintain, but also very cheap to modify.<br>

        <h2>My Second Car - 2006 Subaru Impreza WRX</h2>
        <p>
        My second car was the 2006 Subaru Impreza WRX.<br>
        These cars were and still are popular amoung car enthusiasts due to their heritage in rally racing.<br>
        The WRX is extremely fast and agile on any surface due to its all wheel drive and turbo boxer engine.<br>
