            <h1>Kirsti &amp; Cars!</h1>
            <p>
                I grew up in a family that absolutley loves cars.<br>
                I can easily relate to Marisa Tomei&apos;s character in the movie &quot;My Cousin Vinny&quot;. My father was a mechanic, his father was a mechanic, my brother is a mechanic, all my friends are mechanics...<br>
                Cars have become one of my life long hobbies.

            <h2 class="firstcar">My First Car - 1993 Honda Civic &reg; Hatchback</h2>
            <p>
                My first car was the 1993 Honda Civic Hatchback.<br>
                These cars became extremely popular throughout the 2000&apos;s thanks to the movie &quot;The Fast and The Furious&quot;.<br>
                These cars were very cheap to own and maintain, but also very cheap to modify.<br>

            <p>
                My second car was the 2006 Subaru Impreza WRX.<br>
                These cars were and still are popular amoung car enthusiasts due to their heritage in rally racing.<br>
                The WRX is extremely fast on any surface due to its all wheel drive and turbo boxer engine.<br>

            <h3>Cars are more than just a machine...</h3>
            <p>
                Cars are a big part of what keeps my friends and family engaged with each other.<br>
                We go to the racetrack together, car shows, and work together to keep each others cars at their best.<br>
